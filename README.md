## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC) with C++11 support.
- OpenMP for multithreading.
- AVX/NEON support for SIMD optimizations (optional).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemm-kernel-optimization.git
   cd gemm-kernel-optimization
   ```

2. Build the project using the provided `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run benchmarks:
   ```bash
   ./build/benchmark_naive
   ```

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Naive Implementation
The baseline implementation uses three nested loops for matrix multiplication, showcasing the starting point for optimizations.

### 2. Cache Blocking
Hierarchical blocking reduces cache misses by dividing the matrices into smaller tiles that fit within specific cache levels.

### 3. SIMD Optimization
SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) accelerates matrix operations by performing multiple computations in parallel using AVX or NEON instructions.

### 4. Multithreading
Parallelizes GEMM computations across multiple CPU cores using OpenMP, leveraging modern multicore architectures for performance gains.

## Influences

This project is heavily inspired by the [BLIS framework](./docs/references/blis3_ipdps14.pdf), a high-performance BLAS implementation. Key concepts adopted include:
- Modular design for reusability and extensibility.
- Cache-friendly techniques such as data packing and blocking.
- Efficient use of SIMD and multithreading for hardware acceleration.

For more details, refer to [BLIS-Concepts.md](./docs/BLIS-Concepts.md).

## Performance Analysis

Performance benchmarking compares naive and optimized GEMM implementations, measuring:
- Execution time.
- FLOPs (Floating Point Operations per Second).
- Cache utilization and threading efficiency.

Results are stored in the `results/` directory, and visualization scripts are planned for future updates.
